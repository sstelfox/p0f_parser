The fixture expected to be in this directory should be named p0f.log and can be
generated by running the p0f utility as root for a short period of time (It
shouldn't be empty however). I generated this file using the following command
and just Ctrl-C'd after a couple of minutes.

  # p0f -i em1 -p | tee p0f.log
